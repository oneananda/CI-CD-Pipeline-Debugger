# CI/CD Pipeline Debugger

A platform-agnostic debugging tool for CI/CD pipelines, written in C#. This tool helps developers and DevOps teams identify and resolve issues in their CI/CD pipelines across multiple platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, and more.

## Features

- **Pipeline Visualization**:
  - Interactive representation of pipeline stages, jobs, and tasks.
- **Error Diagnosis**:
  - Real-time log streaming and error tracing.
  - Syntax error and misconfiguration detection.
- **Environment Emulation**:
  - Simulate pipeline runs locally to debug issues before pushing.
- **Configuration Validation**:
  - Validate pipeline configuration files against schema definitions.
- **Multi-Platform Support**:
  - Supports GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, and custom CI/CD tools.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Plugin support for additional debugging tools and integrations.
- **Secure Handling**:
  - Mask sensitive data in logs and identify hard-coded secrets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK**: [.NET 7+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- A compatible operating system: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oneananda/ci-cd-pipeline-debugger.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

### Usage

#### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Run the tool via the CLI to debug a pipeline configuration:
```bash
dotnet run --file path/to/pipeline.yml
```

#### Sample Commands
- Validate a pipeline configuration:
  ```bash
  dotnet run --validate --file path/to/pipeline.yml
  ```
- Debug a pipeline locally:
  ```bash
  dotnet run --debug --file path/to/pipeline.yml
  ```
- Generate a report:
